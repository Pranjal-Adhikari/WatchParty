# Setup Instructions
1. Download the root folder
2. Add the video file you want into the public/ directory with the name "video.mp4"
3. Enter root folder with terminal
4. Type "npm start"

Note: If you want to host this locally, but want to have people join from anywhere, I suggest using Cloudflare's free tunneling.

# Tips and Tricks
- If you're lagging, have all the watchers pause at the same time using the dedicated pause button, then have one person play using the dedicated play button
- Use alongside a video conferencing app. Play the video on this web server, but talk and converse through the dedicated confrencing app (i.e. Zoom)

# Notes
- The closer all the watchers are, the better the connection (duh) and lesser the lag
- I don't know how this works internationally
- The example video is a Blender Open video
